This repo is to demonstrate to git commands.
1. git clone       : Used to access remote repo in local machine.
2. git pull        : To update the changes done in remote repo.
3. git add         : Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing                        it to the official history.
4. git branch      : This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single                      repository.
5. git checkout    : In addition to checking out old commits and old file revisions, git checkout is also the means to navigate existing branches.                              Combined with the basic Git commands, itâ€™s a way to work on a particular line of development.
6. git clean       : Removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which (typically) only operates on                        tracked files.
